This project aims to explore software multithreading on many-core systems using a 68-core Intel Xeon Phi KNL server. 
By leveraging hardware features alongside explicit parallel programming, we investigate the challenges and benefits of software multithreading and message-passing programming models on multiprocessor/multicore systems.
